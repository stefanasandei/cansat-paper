\subsection{Summary of the CPDR}
During the creation of the CDR, we established our team, split up the tasks, made plans on how the rocket was going to launch and what information it was going to gather, and selected what types of sensors and electronics we were going to use. We have mostly determined where each sensor and electronic is going to be bought and what we are going to do with the information gathered.

\subsection{Recommendations for next steps}
After all of our discussions and meetings, nearly everything needed to make this roket a reality has been established. There are two things that still need to be done: figuring out if the radar communication will suffer, because of the antenna that is placed inside and finding where to buy just one of the components needed.
