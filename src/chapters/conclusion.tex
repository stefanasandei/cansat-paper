\subsection*{6.1 Summary of the PDR}
During the creation of the PDR, we established our team, split up the tasks, made plans on how the rocket was going to launch and what information it was going to gather, and selected what types of sensors and electronics we were going to use. We have yet to determine where each sensor and electronic is going to be bought and the specifics of what we are going to do with the analyzed information that we will gather.

\subsection*{6.2 Recommendations for next steps}
During the next discussions we will have to pay more attention to the payload and what it is going to include, so that it will fit the standards and the rocket will be able to reach its maximum height, while using the most powerful engine we can, that being the Aerotech D24T-4 engine. That might involve removing or changing some of the electronic parts. We will also try to gather all of our necessary materials from trusted Romanian websites or shops, in order not to encounter issues such as delayed transport or damaged components, and that will be our final step in establishing our budget. Furthermore, we will continue our research and calculations regarding the recovery system, because, as of right now, we have not decided exactly on how the parachute is going to be deployed.
